The term ‘mulguisin’ is the pronunciation of ‘water ghost’ in Korean. Some people may be familiar with what a water ghost is. The actions and characteristics of water ghosts can vary from country to country and culture to culture. In Korea, a water ghost is defined as follows: “Once wather ghosts caught a person, they never let them go and make them dragged into the water to die. Some people who die because of water ghosts become water ghosts themselves.”

Our algorithm follows the characteristics of such water ghosts (Hereafter Mulguisin or MGS). When creating clusters, elements that are connected under a certain linking length are not let go, and they are formed into a single cluster, like what Mulguisin does. To provide a more detailed explanation, let’s start with the video below.
