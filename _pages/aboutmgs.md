The MulGuisin (MGS, 물귀신) is a Korean word for a ghost that lives in water and is a figure that often appears in old Korean stories. The MGS algorithm started with the idea that the ghosts hiding in the water could be found in the order of height by simply draining the water from the lake.

The MGS software came from the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) Jet-Finding library released in the early 1990s. It has been developed finding high-energy particles in ATLAS experiments.

We found that MGS can be applied to various field, one of them is finding 3D galaxy network. The MGS algorithm is a powerful technique for identifying clusters in data from astrophysical simulations and observations. It consistently produces results closer to those inferred from human visual inspection. MGS also provides auxiliary topological information such as the number and length of connections for each galaxy. With this tool we can explore the use of this enhanced information in testing or constraining cosmological models.

<!-- The term ‘mulguisin’ is the pronunciation of ‘water ghost’ in Korean. Some people may be familiar with what a water ghost is. The actions and characteristics of water ghosts can vary from country to country and culture to culture. In Korea, a water ghost is defined as follows: “Once wather ghosts caught a person, they never let them go and make them dragged into the water to die. Some people who die because of water ghosts become water ghosts themselves.”

Our algorithm follows the characteristics of such water ghosts (Hereafter Mulguisin or MGS). When creating clusters, elements that are connected under a certain linking length are not let go, and they are formed into a single cluster, like what Mulguisin does. To provide a more detailed explanation, let’s start with the video below. -->
