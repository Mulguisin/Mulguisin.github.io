I compared the MGS algorithm with other clustering algorithms such as FoF, MST, and DBSCAN. I applied the MGS algorithm to astronomical data and evaluated its performance. For galaxy data, I tested the MGS algorithm using KIAS-VAGC and Horizon Run 4 simulation datasets. Additionally, I calculated the halo mass function using the Gadget4 simulation to assess the applicability of our algorithm in the fields of astronomy and cosmology.

You can find my slide <a href="https://github.com/csabiu">here</a> which I presented at 2022 KAS spring meeting.
